# Sales Spreadsheet Analysis Project
## Code First Girls Final Project 

This was a group project that I worked together with my team mate, Jade.

Project brief:
- We were given a mock sales dataset for the year 2018 in csv file 
- We were asked to do basic data analysis

Required Tasks:
1. Read the data from the spreadsheet
2. Collect all of the sales from each month into a single list
3. Output the total sales across all months

Our approach:
- Using Trello board to break down the project. Working with Kanban
- We thought it would be great to visualise the summary of results in a dashboard
- We paired program on the required tasks using Replit so we worked through the solutions together
- We extended the project by:
  - Doing further sales metrics 
  - Visualising data with charts 
  - Using Flask microframework to output the summary of results and chart as a dashboard
    
Things that could be improved:
- Refactoring of code. Perhaps separation of concerns for sales_metrics function that return multiple variables
- Working out how to run chart_viz as it saves the chart file when Flask app is running, rather than running it separately

Future features of dashboard that can be added:
- More charts to show how the business is effectively trading ie: 
    - plotting monthly % change over the year
    - plotting quarterly sales data
    - plotting cumulative data over the year
    - plotting profit percentage per month over the year
- Interactive dashboard where:
  - we could hover over the chart and it shows its data point
  - filter relevant data as needed

Personally I have learnt so much through this project:
- Technical aspect of problem solving in Python
- Teamwork
- Technical communication
